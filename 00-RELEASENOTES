Hello! This file is just a placeholder, since this branch is where all the development happens.

There is no release notes for this branch, it gets forked into another branch every time there
is a partial feature freeze in order to eventually create a new stable release.

Usually this branch is stable enough for you to use it in development environments.
However you should never use it in production environments.

Happy hacking!
