# Developer Guide


## Build Environment Setup

For development purposes, it is recommended to use <b>VSCode</b>, which is already configured to run within a Docker container and is integrated with clang-tidy and clang-format. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. <b>Install VSCode Extensions:</b>
    - Install the `Dev Containers` extension by Microsoft in VSCode.
    - Note: Building the code may take some time, and it is important to use a host with decent CPU capacity. If you prefer, you can use a remote host. In that case, also install the following extensions:
      - `Remote - SSH` by Microsoft
      - `Remote Explorer` by Microsoft

2. <b>Run the dev container setup script</b>
    - Issue the following command from the cloned repo root directory:
        ```bash
        .devcontainer/setup.sh
        ```

3. <b>Open the Repository in VSCode:</b>
    - On your local machine, open the root directory of the cloned valkey-search repository in VSCode.
    - If the repository is located on a remote host:
      1. Press Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (macOS) to open the Command Palette.
      2. Type Remote-SSH: Connect to Host and select it.
      3. Choose the appropriate host and provide any necessary authentication details.

       Once connected, VSCode will open the repository in the context of the remote host.


## Manual Setup of Build Environment

If you prefer to manually set up the development environment instead of using the dev container, follow these steps. However, if you have already set up your environment to use the dev container, thereâ€™s no need to follow this section.

valkey-search is built using the Bazel build system. It is recommended to use [Bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk) installed as `bazel`, to avoid Bazel compatibility issues.

On Linux, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ca-certificates -y && sudo update-ca-certificates
sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/bazel https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases/latest/download/bazelisk-linux-$([ $(uname -m) = "aarch64" ] && echo "arm64" || echo "amd64")
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bazel
```

Add /usr/local/bin to your path:

```bash
grep -q 'export PATH=.*:/usr/local/bin' ~/.bashrc || echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Build requires `gcc/g++` version 11 or higher, and `glibc` to be available on the host. On a Debian-based distribution, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install -y libc6-dev gcc g++

# If your gcc version is below 11, continue with the following:
# Add PPA to be able to newer gcc/g++ versions
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt update

# Install gcc-11 and g++-11
sudo apt install -y gcc-11 g++-11

# Set gcc-11 and g++-11 as the default compilers
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-11 100
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-11 100
```

### Toolchain


Bazel is setup to download and use llvm toolchain automatically.


To switch to the host compiler, comment out the `register_toolchains` line 
in [MODULE.bazel](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-search/blob/main/MODULE.bazel#L29).
Both GCC and Clang are supported, with GCC set as the default.


If you are using Clang, run the following prior to invoking the build:


```bash
echo "build --config=clang" > .bazelrc_local
```


Known supported versions:
- GCC >= 12.2.0
- Clang >= 16.0.6


### Building the Module

To perform a non-optimized build, use the following command:

```bash
bazel build //src:valkeysearch
```

For an optimized binary, suitable for production or benchmarking, use:

```bash
bazel build -c opt --config=lto //src:valkeysearch
```

To include the symbol table:

```bash
bazel build --copt=-g --linkopt=-g --strip=never //src:valkeysearch
```

## Testing

All the tests can be built and run with:

```bash
bazel test //testing/...
```

An individual test target can be run with a more specific Bazel [label](https://bazel.build/versions/master/docs/build-ref.html#Labels), e.g. to build and run only
the units tests in [testing/ft_search_test.cc](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-search/blob/main/testing/ft_search_test.cc):

```bash
bazel test //testing:ft_search_test
```

To observe more verbose test output:

```bash
bazel test --test_output=streamed //testing:ft_search_test
```

It's also possible to pass into a test additional command-line args via `--test_arg`. For
example, for extremely verbose test debugging:

```bash
bazel test --test_output=streamed //testing:ft_search_test --test_arg="-l trace"
```

By default, tests are run with the [gperftools](https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools) heap
checker enabled in "normal" mode to detect leaks. For other mode options, see the gperftools
heap checker [documentation](https://gperftools.github.io/gperftools/heap_checker.html). To
disable the heap checker or change the mode, set the HEAPCHECK environment variable:

```bash
# Disables the heap checker
bazel test //testing/... --test_env=HEAPCHECK=
# Changes the heap checker to "minimal" mode
bazel test //testing/... --test_env=HEAPCHECK=minimal
```

Bazel will by default cache successful test results. To force it to rerun tests:

```bash
bazel test  //testing:ft_search_test --cache_test_results=no
```

Bazel will by default run all tests inside a sandbox, which disallows access to the
local filesystem. If you need to break out of the sandbox (for example to run under a
local script or tool with [`--run_under`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/user-manual.html#flag--run_under)),
you can run the test with `--strategy=TestRunner=local`, e.g.:

```bash
bazel test //testing:ft_search_test --strategy=TestRunner=local --run_under=/some/path/foobar.sh
```

### Integration Testing

To run any integration tests, you will need to have a local build of both valkey-server and valkey-cli. You can retrieve these by downloading the [Valkey source code and building it locally](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/).

Once you have downloaded and built Valkey, you can run the integration tests:

```
bazel test //testing/integration:vector_search_integration_test --test_arg=--valkey_server_path=/path/to/valkey-server --test_arg=--valkey_cli_path=/path/to/valkey-cli
```

Additionally, it is recommended to run the stability test suite, which requires a local build of [Memtier](https://github.com/RedisLabs/memtier_benchmark):

```
bazel test //testing/integration:stability_test --test_arg=--valkey_server_path=/path/to/valkey-server --test_arg=--valkey_cli_path=/path/to/valkey-cli --test_arg=--memtier_path=/path/to/memtier_benchmark --test_output=streamed
```

## Loading

ValkeySearch is compatible with any version of Valkey and can also be loaded into Redis versions 7.0 and 7.2. To load the module, execute the following command:

```bash
/path/to/valkey-server "--loadmodule /path/to/libvalkeysearch.so  --reader-threads 64 --writer-threads 64"
```

For optimal performance, set the --reader-threads and --writer-threads parameters to match the number of vCPUs available on your machine.

## Coding Style/Quality

We follow the [Google coding style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) and use `clang-tidy` and `clang-format` to enforce code quality and ensure adherence to this style guide.

### Installation

To set up the necessary tools on a Debian-based distribution, follow these steps:


1. Install the LLVM repository and set it up:
```bash
sudo bash -c "$(wget -O - https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh)"
```

2. Install clang-tidy and related dependencies for your latest supported version:
```bash
sudo apt install -y clang-16 clang++-16
sudo update-alternatives --set clang /usr/bin/clang-16
sudo update-alternatives --set clang++ /usr/bin/clang++-16
sudo apt install libc++-16-dev libc++abi-16-dev clang-tidy-16
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang-tidy clang-tidy /usr/bin/clang-tidy-16 100
```

### Running Clang-Tidy Locally
clang-tidy requires knowledge of the project build configuration to function correctly. To achieve this, follow these steps:

1. Generate the build configuration:
```bash
bazel run @hedron_compile_commands//:refresh_all
```

2. Run `clang-tidy` on a specific file: 
```bash
clang-tidy -p compile_commands.json src/some_file.cc
```


### Convenience Script

A convenient script has been provided to automate the process of running clang-tidy and clang-format on your local changes. You can execute it with:

```bash
ci/check_changes.sh --cached
```

- `--cached` is an optional parameter which direct the script to check the staged files, i.e., the files that have been added to the staging area (via git add) but not yet committed.
