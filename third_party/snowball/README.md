# Snowball Stemming Library

## What is Snowball?
Snowball is a algorithmic stemming library that reduces words to their morphological root form (e.g., "running" â†’ "run"). It uses language-specific algorithms compiled from high-level `.sbl` rule definitions into efficient C code.

## How We Use It
We integrate only the minimal Snowball runtime (128KB) with UTF-8 language support. The `valkey_search::indexes::Stemmer` class provides a clean C++ wrapper around the Snowball C API for text preprocessing in search indexes.

## Commands

### Add Language Support
```bash
./add_language.sh french german spanish
```
Adds new stemming languages by downloading the latest Snowball compiler, generating language-specific C code, and updating both modules.h and CMakeLists.txt with the new languages.

### Remove Language Support  
```bash
./remove_language.sh french german
```
Removes specified languages and regenerates both modules.h and CMakeLists.txt to exclude removed languages.

### Update Existing Languages
```bash
./update_languages.sh
```
Updates all currently installed language binaries to the latest versions from the Snowball repository. This is useful for getting algorithm improvements and bug fixes without changing the language list. Also updates CMakeLists.txt for consistency.

### List Available Languages
**Currently supported**: english (add more via scripts)

**Available for addition**: arabic, armenian, basque, catalan, danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german, greek, hindi, hungarian, indonesian, irish, italian, lithuanian, nepali, norwegian, portuguese, romanian, russian, serbian, spanish, swedish, tamil, turkish, yiddish

**Aliases supported**: Each language has multiple aliases (e.g., english/en/eng, french/fr/fre/fra)
